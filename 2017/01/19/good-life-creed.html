<p># Good Life Project’s Living Creed</p>

<p>### Jonathan Fields</p>

<p>Don’t try to be different, own the fact that you already are.</p>

<p>Be fierce with your time, but generous with your heart. Presence not presents.</p>

<p>The biggest wall you’ve gotta climb is the one you build in your mind.</p>

<p>You don’t need a hammer to knock it down, just the will to act.</p>

<p>Find awe, let it shake you, melt you, lift you then share it.</p>

<p>Ritualize the Mundane to make room for the brilliant.</p>

<p>Have a strategy, but be open to serendipity. The best things in life are rarely planned.</p>

<p>Life is a story, if you wouldn’t read the one you’re telling, write a different ending.</p>

<p>Genius begins with a burning question, What’s yours?</p>

<p>You will never have perfect information, Act anyway.</p>

<p>It’s more important to choose than to choose right.</p>

<p>Don’t confuse genuine peace of mind with the passing lack of angst that follows the demise of the dream but preceeds a mounting wave of regret.</p>

<p>Easy is not always right.</p>

<p>Embrace the thrash, Uncertainty is a signpost of possibility.</p>

<p>When you align What you do with who you are you’ll become what you need to be.</p>

<p>Build a tribe. People matter.</p>

<p>Love so deeply it cracks open the world.</p>

<p>Hug people hello, then hold onto the ones who don’t run for the hills.</p>

<p>Serve others, but don’t live your life through them.</p>

<p>Expose your soul, Vulnerability is a gateway to strength.</p>

<p>Pause often, Listen deeply.</p>

<p>Move your body, Feed your brain.</p>

<p>Lighten up. If you can’t laugh at yourself, others will happily do it for you.</p>

<p>The quest to create something from nothing is a wholly irrational act. Do it anyway.</p>

<p>Create, Don’t replicate.</p>

<p>Failure is only failure when it doesn’t move you forward.</p>

<p>Choose Gratitude over Greed.</p>

<p>A Good Life isn’t a place at which you arrive, it is a lens through which you see and create your world.</p>

<p>Rise up. Be your own guru.</p>

<p>This is the big show.</p>

<p>Make meaning.</p>
